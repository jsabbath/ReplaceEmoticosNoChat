"eLouai smilies"
================
eLouai smiley icons are freely available for use in non-commercial environments.
eLouai, Ren and Stimpy and Tiny Toons were rendered over 10 years ago (1993).
As I dreg up old files I will be posting them on this site for posterity :)<br/>

Note: the AOL, YAHOO, ICQ and MSN Smileys have only been zipped and listed on elouai.com 
for easy reference, please contact the respective sites regarding their usage.

If you find elouai.com to be an entertaining or useful resource site,
